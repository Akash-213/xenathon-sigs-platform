## SIGs Platform

This project was developed for the hackathon hosted by PCSB during the annual event Xenia'21. The topic that we choose for project was **'SIG and Training Conduction App'**.
We have developed this app in Flutter using Firebase as the backend and storage. 

## Introduction 


## Features of Apps  
- A user can register using their Google account.
-  If any user has acquired any skill and he/she wants to teach that to others, they can post it on the app.
-  The post will include the Title, short description, proficiency, topics to be covered, date and time of event, expected count, meeting link.
-  Once the post has been created, other users can view it in the explore tab.
- If the user is interested to attend, they click on the interested button to confirm their availability.
- When the interested count has exceeded the expected count (given by the tutor) , the event gets confirmed and is displayed in the Schedule Tab.
- A user can join the meeting by clicking on the join now button.
